# Klein

A small, minimal, embeddable scripting language.

Klein is meant to fill the same niche as Lua&mdash;dead simple and highly embeddable scripting&mdash;with some improvements, notably:

- A simple TypeScript-like type system
- Improved ergonomics for iterators, tables and lists
- More built-in functionality for tables and lists
- Less ways of doing the same thing
